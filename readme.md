# Aurelia On Node

This project demonstrates using aurelia with nodejs as a host and as a
server for backend webservices.  Babel is used for compiling both the
client and server code, so this gives you a full ES6 stack to write with.

## Running This

Dependencies:

- node / npm
- gulp-cli
- mongo (installed locally with an empty database named "bookcollection")

At the command line at the project root:

```
npm install
jspm install
gulp
```

And you should be all set.
